========== iOS Banner Example ==========

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google AdMob Ads SDK. You must
add the SDK library and header files into your application.  The SDK files can
be downloaded from https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/.

You must also include you publisher ID from AdMob or publisher ID and ad slot ID
from Ad Exchange in the SampleConstants.h file in order to successfully receive ads.
